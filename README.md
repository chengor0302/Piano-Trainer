## About Me
Hi! My name is Chen, and I am a **Computer Science B.Sc. graduate from Ben-Gurion University**.  
I love playing the piano, so I thought of creating an app to help others start learning it too!

## About the Project
**Piano-Trainer** is designed to make learning musical notes and chords fun and interactive.  
The app currently includes features such as:  

- **Guess the Note** – click the correct note on the interactive piano keyboard.  
- **Instant feedback** – shows whether your answer was correct or wrong.  
- **Scoring system** – points increase for correct answers.  
- **Countdown timer** – challenge yourself before time runs out.  
- **Custom note designs** – all musical notes were designed in Figma to provide a clear and visually appealing interface.

> ⚠️ **Work in progress:** The project is still under development, and more games, lessons, and features will be added soon.

## Technologies Used
- **React** – for building interactive UI components.  
- **TypeScript** – for type safety and better code organization.  
- **CSS** – for styling the piano and feedback messages.  
- **Cloudinary** – hosting images for musical notes.  
- **Figma** – designed custom note images used in the app.
